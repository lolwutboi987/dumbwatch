dumbwatch is powered by the Nordic Semiconductor based XIAO nRF52840. The builtin BMS of the XIAO nRF52840 allows the watch to remain extremely compact, while the deepsleep capabilties and builtin RTC allow for a non-refreshing power draw of 5 microamps. dumbwatch uses a high-efficiency, high visibility eink display to be both highly visible in daylight, and use an extremely small amount of electricity. While the name and appearance may be decieving, dumbwatch with the XIAO nRF52840 is capable of reading notifications, communicating data such as weather, location, or other customizable features thanks to it's simple, yet open source free-programmable nature. dumbwatch is also compatible with any XIAO mcu with builtin BMS
