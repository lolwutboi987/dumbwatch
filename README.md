a somewhat dumb, yet smart watch with a ridiculously long battery life. 
dumbwatch is powered by the Nordic Semiconductor based XIAO nRF52840. The builtin BMS of the XIAO nRF52840 allows the watch to remain extremely compact, while the deepsleep capabilties and builtin RTC allow for a non-refreshing power draw of 5 microamps. dumbwatch uses a high-efficiency, high visibility eink display to be both highly visible in daylight, and use an extremely small amount of electricity. While the name and appearance may be decieving, dumbwatch with the XIAO nRF52840 is capable of reading notifications, communicating data such as weather, location, or other customizable features thanks to it's simple, yet open source free-programmable nature. dumbwatch is also compatible with any XIAO mcu with builtin BMS, making it customizable with other XIAO boards like the smarter ESP32 S3 for AI capability, at the cost of battery power. 
dumbwatch achieves it's long battery life with one simple concept: it only needs to be on for 200 miliseconds per minute (or whatever refresh interval you set). during the other 59800 miliseconds passing every minute, dumbwatch is only pulling 5 microamps to keep it's internal RTC ticking. this means with a refresh interval of 1 minute, it has a battery life of 3 months. In more extreme scenarios, such as camping, one could set the interval for 5 minutes, effectively extending the life to 15 months.
